    "### Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Important emails**:\n",
    "  - Recall of **0.78** indicates that the model successfully captures most important emails.\n",
    "  - Precision of **0.83** ensures that the important inbox is not flooded with noise.\n",
    "  - No important emails are misclassified as spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spam safety**:\n",
    "  - Spam precision is **1.00**, meaning no legitimate emails are incorrectly flagged as spam.\n",
    "  - Only one spam email is misclassified as important, which is acceptable and controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Promotional emails**:\n",
    "  - High recall (**0.92**) shows strong separation from important and spam classes.\n",
    "  - Some promotions are intentionally upgraded to important, reflecting the recall-focused objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Log Loss Analysis (Generalization Check)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Log Loss:** 0.304  \n",
    "- **Test Log Loss:** 0.458  \n",
    "\n",
    "The close alignment between cross-validation and test log loss indicates:\n",
    "- No evidence of overfitting\n",
    "- Stable probability calibration\n",
    "- Good generalization to unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "*By introducing a higher class weight for important emails, the model achieves a **significant improvement in recall** while maintaining strong precision and strict spam safety. Cross-validation confirmed that this improvement generalizes well, and test results validate the expected trade-offs.*\n"
