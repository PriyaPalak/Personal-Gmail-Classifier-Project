# Personal-Gmail-Classifier-Project
Collected 10 years of email data via Google API and manually labeled a stratified sample of 1.2K emails across Important, Promotional, and Spam classes. Trained a TF-IDF–based multiclass logistic regression model; improved Important-class recall from 0.59 → 0.78 using class-weighted log-loss optimization with cross-validation.
